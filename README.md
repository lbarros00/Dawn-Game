# Dawn - A Platform Game

A platform game using 2D assets for the environment and UI visual design and 3D assets for player and non-player characters. It is still in beta phase. But we had the chance to represent The City College of New York at the NYC CS Fair 2019 and have high school students test it and give us feedback.
